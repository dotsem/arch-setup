- Created udev rules to disable USB autosuspend
- Added sysctl configuration
- Automatically applied during installation

### ✓ Separate essentials & non-essential packages
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Implementation**: 
- `config/packages-essential.sh` - Critical system packages
- `config/packages-nonessential.sh` - Optional packages
- `lib/package-manager.sh` - Shared installation logic

### ✓ Sysunit (system unittest)
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Implementation**: `bin/sysunit`
- Validates kernel functionality
- Tests network connectivity
- Checks audio system (PipeWire)
- Verifies display configuration
- Validates shell setup (Zsh)
- Tests Git configuration
- Checks package managers
- Tests Python environment
- Validates directory structure
- Checks boot configuration
- Verifies security (firewall)
- Tests Flutter (if installed)
- Can be run from terminal: `sysunit`

### ✓ Après setup script
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Implementation**: `bin/apres-setup`
- Installs non-essential packages
- Runs system tests (sysunit) after completion
- Progress stored in `~/.cache/apres-setup-progress`
- Can run in background
- Available as command: `apres-setup`
  - `apres-setup start` - Start/resume
  - `apres-setup status` - Check progress
  - `apres-setup stop` - Pause installation
  - `apres-setup reset` - Start over
  - `apres-setup log` - View logs
- Disappears when complete (removes progress file)

### ✓ Update packages to more efficient versions (bin versions)
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Implementation**: `config/packages-nonessential.sh`
**Updated packages**:
- `visual-studio-code-bin` (instead of building from source)
- `google-chrome` (binary package)
- `zen-browser-bin`
- `vesktop-bin`
- `discord-bin`
- `spotify-bin`
- `neofetch-bin`
- `yay-bin`
- `btop-bin`
- `postman-bin`
- `insomnia-bin`
- `flutter` (note: flutter-bin also available)
- `obs-studio` (pre-built)

### ✓ Add extra setup
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**New modules added**:
- `modules/usb.sh` - USB autosuspend configuration
- `modules/flutter.sh` - Flutter environment and Kolibri Shell
- `lib/package-manager.sh` - Enhanced package management
**Enhanced existing**:
- Better error handling throughout
- Progress tracking system
- Resume capability
- System validation

### ✓ Add setup for taskbar (Kolibri Shell)
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Implementation**: `modules/flutter.sh`
**Features**:
- Detects Flutter installation
- Accepts Android licenses
- Clones https://github.com/dotsem/kolibri-shell
- Runs `flutter pub get`
- Builds with `flutter build linux --release`
- Creates symlink in `~/.local/bin/kolibri-shell`
- Ready to use after installation

## Architecture Improvements ✓

### ✓ Improved code organization
- Separated concerns into logical modules
- Created dedicated folders:
  - `bin/` - Executable commands
  - `config/` - Package configurations
  - `lib/` - Shared libraries
  - `modules/` - Feature modules
  - `helpers/` - Utility functions

### ✓ Better error handling
- All steps continue on error
- Errors are tracked and reported at end
- Failed packages/steps listed in summary
- Detailed logging to file

### ✓ Progress tracking and resume
- `apres-setup` saves progress after each package
- Can stop and resume at any time
- Survives system reboots
- Skips already-completed steps

### ✓ Modular design
- Easy to add new modules
- Each module is self-contained
- Clear dependencies between modules
- Simple to customize

### ✓ Documentation
- `README.md` - Complete guide
- `MIGRATION.md` - Migration from old script
- `TODO-STATUS.md` - This file
- Inline code comments
- Function documentation

## Additional Enhancements Made

### System validation
- Created comprehensive test suite
- Tests all critical system components
- Easy to run: `sysunit`
- Clear pass/fail output

### Installation workflow
- Phase 1: Essential packages (fast)
- Phase 2: Non-essential packages (optional)
- Phase 3: System validation
- Clear next steps after each phase

### User experience
- Colored output for clarity
- Progress indicators
- Clear error messages
- Helpful command suggestions
- Status checking

### Reliability
- Retry logic for package installation
- Lock file prevents concurrent runs
- PID tracking for background processes
- Graceful error recovery
- Clean shutdown handling

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

These are not in the original TODO but could be added:

### Could be added:
- [ ] Web-based progress viewer
- [ ] Email/notification on completion
- [ ] Parallel package installation
- [ ] Automatic system snapshots
